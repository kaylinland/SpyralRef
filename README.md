## Spyral References

Spyral Notebooks work side by side with Voyant Tools. Create interactive notebooks with code and text to save your Voyant results, expand them, and perform robust textual analysis using JavaScript. 

Use this site to find Spyral reference material and tutorials. 

### Reference Material

The official Spyral documentation written in JS Docs is located at https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/api/Spyral.Notebook (Experience Level: Expert) 

For Spyral Notebooks containing expanded code samples following the documentation, we have created the Spyral Reference Manual. Each section of the reference manual consists of sample code that can be copied and pasted into your own Spyral Notebooks. (Experience Level: Intermediate)
